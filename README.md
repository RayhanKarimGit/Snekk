# Snekk
This is a simple snake game in which a snake travelling on an 18 x 18 grid gets longer every time it consumes an apple at a random spawn location. This program also contains very simple GUI (Menu screen and a pause screen with buttons). It was created using the pygame library.

This game was coded in python due to pygame's helpful library with game development. I also wanted to learn python so this is my first project using python. 

## How can I run the game?

Download the zip file from the repository, extract the zip file, launch Snekk.exe and start playing!
